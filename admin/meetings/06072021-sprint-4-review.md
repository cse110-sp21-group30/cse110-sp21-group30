## Side Note
The review and retrospective for sprints 2 and 3 were completed together, which is why there are no separate documents for sprint 3 in the meetings directory.

## Main Points
- We've developed a functional product with all the core features we hoped to implement.
- We've set up more thorough automated unit and e2e tests.
- We've polished the UI by providing multiple color schemes, a unified set of icons, and improving the intuitive design of our application
