##  Agenda
### Previous Meeting 

(Sprint 2 + 3 Review, 05/30/2021 from 6:30-7PM PST)

Gathered comments and feedback from all members on the lastSprint, and brainstormed ways to improve the next sprint.

### Final Touches
Our project is fully functional, though there are still some changes we'd like to make to testing, code, and documentation by Monday (06/07/2021) night:
- (Testing) We're aiming to implement more thorough tests for the Archive (archiving a bullet and checking that it actually shows in the Archive) and to add a test for the color theme selector
- (Code) We're still interested in adding an actual bullet point to the text area in our bullet points, and after any final edits to the project itself have been made we plan to make a final sweep of the source files to make sure all code is properly styled
- (Documentation) We'd like to add a couple new ADRs for some decisions we've made in the last week (we changed our approach to editing existing bullets, and we added the color theme feature)
Note: final edits to documentation/code style can be completed on Tuesday, but everything listed here MUST be done by Wednesday so we can prepare our final videos. All new features (even simple UI fixes) must be completed by Monday night.

We plan to meet again on Monday at 6PM PST (those who have finals scheduled at/near this time are obviously not require to attend) for a final sprint retrospective/review and to talk about our plans for how to tackle the remaining Canvas assignments. We will also use this time to delegate any tasks that have yet to be completed.

## Tasks

### Completed Tasks
- We have a functional application
- Our CI/CD Pipeline is almost complete
- Our ADRs are almost complete

### Tasks to be Completed
- Finish adding any new project features/enhancements by Monday night
- Implement the new tests by Monday night
- Make this repository public and publish a Github Page so we can direct tests to run on that page (instead of the test server we currently have set up) and provide the link to our application in the README
- Any changes to code style and documentation must be locked in by Tuesday night
- Record and edit our final (public and private) project videos

Additionally, each member should be aware of the following assignments on Canvas that are to be completed individually:
- Software Futures Article Response (due 06/08/2021)
- Team Member Evaluations - Final (due 06/10/2021)
- Individual Retrospective (due 06/10/2021)
