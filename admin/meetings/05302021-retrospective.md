## Overview
During the retrospective meeting we aimed to gather feedback from all members on our last sprints and ways to improve future sprints. Below are the topics covered and points brought up by members.

### Thoughts, Comments, and Concerns
Andrew:

Is glad to see the progress made so far and to be nearly back on track with our original roadmap. Just wants to encourage everyone to keep up the productivity as we go into preparation for finals week.

Angus:

Any concerns/comments were already mentioned by other members.

Eric:

We should strive to maintain more consistent communication between the back- and front-end so that we can stay aware of what we need to do to support each other. Both teams should be transparent about what they need the other to do so we can gauge what order to finish tasks in.

Ikjoon:

Any concerns/comments were already mentioned by other members.

Joe:

The system for making pull requests was a bit confusing at first but was made clear by another member. We should be sure to thoroughly communicate any potentially-confusing processes for making changes to the project, running tests, etc. in the future.

Nataly:

Breaking off into smaller groups and working as individuals has definitely increased efficiency over the past couple of weeks/sprints. We should still take care to plan out any design/implementation choices in advance to save ourselves time and avoid having to scrap work that doesn't pair well with exising code/features other members are working on.

Sonika:

Any concerns/comments were already mentioned by other members.

Thet:

Despite some setbacks in the front-end's meeting to implement the Archive, we made good progress this week towards finishing a minimum viable product and in making some aesthetic improvements to the project. 

### Challenges
One of our members has faced family and personal emergencies during the last two sprints that meant they had less time to dedicate to the project. With late midterms and finals coming up soon, all of our members are working hard to strike a balance between their studies for other classes and their work towards the project.

### Changes to Implement in Future Sprints
All members should strive to be more communicative about any roadblocks, areas of confusion, etc. as we go into our (probably) last sprint. Much of the challenges and setbacks in these past couple of weeks have been due to a lack of communication, so to ensure that we deliver a final product that we're proud of we shouldn't shy away from discussing problems with team members.
