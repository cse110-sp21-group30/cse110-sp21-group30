## Agenda
### Previous Meeting

(Overhaul of Previous Design Part 2, 05/12/2021 from 1:45-2:45PM PST)

We finished discussing changes to the project design and began modifying our ADRs, wireframe, etc. accordingly.

### Coding Session
While the front- and back-end teams have been merged into one and all members participated in the coding session, members still broke apart according to their old groups in order to focus on the UI/behind-the-scenes components of the application. In the future it appears likely that more tasks will be handled by the front-end (such as migration of tasks, accepting user input, etc.), so all members will end up working on the same components.

## Tasks

### Completed Tasks
- Completed a non-functional prototype (doesn't accept user input or display dynamically-created bullets) for the home page, with placeholders for the dates overview and fake

### Tasks to be Completed
- We still need to finish reflecting the changes to our design across the repo
- We need to complete the following assignments on Canvas:
    - Agile Video (due 5/17)
    - CI/CD Phase 1 (due 5/17)
        - Specifically, we need to implement some workflows (actions), record a video explaining them, and craft a 2-page status report
    - 1st Sprint Meeting -Notes- (due 5/18)
    - Retrospective -Notes- (due 5/18)
