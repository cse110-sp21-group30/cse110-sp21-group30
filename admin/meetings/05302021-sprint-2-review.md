## Main Points
- We've completed a minimum viable product (just have to resolve some duplicate IDs and missing image alt fields before we can merge into main).
- We've set up automated unit and e2e tests.
- We almost have search-by-date and search-by-label implemented.
- We've highlighted points of improvement for the user interface and experience (which we can now focus on as we've completed most core features).
