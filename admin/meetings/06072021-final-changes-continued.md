##  Agenda
### Previous Meeting 

(Final Changes, 06/06/2021 from 6-7PM PST)

Came up with a list of features, further tests, and further documentation that we would like to have in our repo by Tuesday (06/08/2021) at the latest.

### Final Touches (Continued)

We plan to meet again on Monday at 6PM PST (those who have finals scheduled at/near this time are obviously not require to attend) for a final sprint retrospective/review and to talk about our plans for how to tackle the remaining Canvas assignments. We will also use this time to delegate any tasks that have yet to be completed.

## Tasks
We assigned remaining tasks to specific team members with deadlines of tonight (Monday, 06/07/2021) for any new features/bug fixes/tests and tomorrow night (Tuesday, 06/08/2021) for improvements to code style and documentation. We also arranged to meet on Wednesday (06/09/2021) to film our final videos for the project.

### Completed Tasks
- We've implemented more thorough tests for the Archive
- We've fixed a few more minor bugs with the UI of our application

### Tasks to be Completed
Refactoring/Code Style Improvements:
- Thet will handle bullet-point.js
- Angus will handle color.js
- Sonika will handle router.js
- Andrew will handle script-test.js
- Nataly will handle index.html and style.css

Note that our team's style guidelines are as follows:
- Variable names should be in snake_case
- Variable and function names should be apt/self explanatory
- Lines should end in semicolons (except in HTML files)
- Comments should be concise and only made where necessary to clarify the purpose of code
- Short comments should be preceded by // and long comments should be captured in a similar format to jsDoc style (in JS files)
- Indentation should be uniform across a file

ADRs:
- Joe will create an ADR for the new color themes and toggle
- Nataly will create an ADR for the new editor modal (which handles editing existing bullet points)

CI/CD Pipeline:
- Nataly will create a final CI/CD Pipeline update document

Additionally, each member should be aware of the following assignments on Canvas that are to be completed individually:
- Software Futures Article Response (due 06/08/2021)
- Team Member Evaluations - Final (due 06/10/2021)
- Individual Retrospective (due 06/10/2021)
