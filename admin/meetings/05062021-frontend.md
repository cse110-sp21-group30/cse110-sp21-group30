##  Agenda
### Previous Meeting 

(Finalizing the Pitch, 05/03/2021 from 6-7PM PST)

Finished building the pitch document and wireframe diagrams for the "Starting Pitch" assignment on Canvas. The front- and back-end developers decided to meet separately to begin working on their respective parts of the project.

### Front-end Coding Session
The front-end will be responsible for handling interactions with the user (displaying the appropriate journal entries, grabbing search terms and new/edited journals, etc.) and the back-end will handle interactions with the database (finding the specified journals, storing new journals or modified journals in the database, etc.).

With this in mind, the front-end developers began testing out different ways to implement the basic wireframe laid out in previous meetings with placeholders for sections where journal entries and additional notes sections should normally be displayed. This code is contained in the Frontend_Testing branch. Placeholders will be removed once the database is set up.

## Tasks

### Completed Tasks

- Basic login page is set up (without checks in place for existing/new users)
- Created a nav bar for the different tabs
- Experimented with ways to change the display according to the selected tab

### Tasks to be Completed
- Complete monthly/past/future/and custom tabs, which will involve:
    - Creating a fixed/sticky header that have buttons and links for the user to switch between tabs, enter search terms, log out, or create a new entry
    - Creating placeholders for areas where journal entries and notes sections should be displayed
    - (Specific to the monthly tab) Create a title that displays the name of the current month
    - (Specific to the past tab) Create a title labeled 'Past'
    - (Specific to the future tab) Create a title labeled 'Future'
    - (Specific to the custom tab) Create a title labeled 'Custom'
