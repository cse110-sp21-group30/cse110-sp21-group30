## Agenda
### Previous Meeting

(Sprint 1 Review, 05/17/2021 from 7:30-8PM PST)

We discussed challenges we encountered during the first sprint and gathered comments/feedback from individual members. We then determined some changes to implement for our next sprint (documented in the retrospective minutes).

### Coding Session
The front- and back-end worked together to implement a basic bullet point component that can be loaded up from localStorage or generated from user input (gathered from the editor).

## Tasks

### Completed Tasks
- Completed a basic bullet point component.

### Tasks to be Completed
- We still need to finish reflecting the changes to our design in some ADR documents and the pitch
- In our next meeting we will determine if we need to hold another group coding session or if we will begin breaking off into smaller groups (or work individually) for the remainder of the project
