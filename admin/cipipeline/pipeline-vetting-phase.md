### Comments and Code Style
- Comments should only be added where the code is not self-explanatory
- Concise comments are better than verbose comments
- (in Javascript) Short comments should be preceded by // and long comments should be captured in jsDoc style
- Variable and function names will use snake_case
- Variable and function names should be apt/self-explanatory
- Lines should end with semicolons (except in HTML)

### Pull Requests
- Pull requests should include no more than 250 lines of change (apart from the initial skeleton)
- Pull requests should only do/change one thing
    - Whenever possible, larger requests should be broken down into smaller ones
- Titles should be self-explanatory and descriptions should cover what/why/how a piece of code was changes
- Pull requests should be reviewed and approved by 1-2 people before being merged

### Testing
- We will add unit tests to our workflow as we begin storing and loading bullet points from localStorage.
- We will look into e2e and pixel testing for the next phase, as well as Jest, Tape, Ava, Cypress, Mocha/Chai for running unit tests
