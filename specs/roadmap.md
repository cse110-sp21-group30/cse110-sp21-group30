As of 4/25/2021, our goals are:

- Week 7: Have a Minimum Viable Product ready (should be able to create a post on the front-end and store in the back-end, view posts in the monthly tab, and handle GET/POST requests).
- Week 8: Our own version of Markdown and tabs/labels should be implemented
- Week 9: Migration should be implemented
- Week 10: Finishing touches

(This is subject to change as we gain a better understanding of the workload.)
