Our previous roadmap goals had to be pushed back as we decided to make make significant changes to our project design after consulting a TA and the professor.

As of 5/16/2021, our new goals for the project are:

- Beginning of Week 8: Have a skeleton prepared
    - This means a non-interactive implementation of the wireframe
- Beginning of Week 9: Have a Minimum Viable Product ready
    - This means an interactive application (dynamic creation, editing, migration, and deletion of bullet points)
- Week 10: Finishing touches
    - This means search-by-date and search-by-label functions should be implemented, along with any additional decorative improvements (if time allows)
