# Labels
Date: [05-10-2021]

## Context and Problem Statement
We want to allow users to add certain attributes to their journal entries to further help with organization. 

## Considered Options
1. Custom tags that users can create and attach as labels to their journal
2. Predetermined tags that users can use as attributes.

## Decision Outcome
We decided to implement option (2) initially because while giving the user less control, it is easier for us as developers to know what labels are being used.  We will designate a predetermined list of tags like “school” or “urgent” so that the user can label each entry using this. This will be easy to manage on our end, and easy for the user to take advantage of.
