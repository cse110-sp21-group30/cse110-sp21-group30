# Search
Date: [05-10-2021]

## Context and Problem Statement
We would like users to be able to search through their extensive list of journals in a simple manner.

## Considered Options
1. Allowing users to search by date.
2. Allowing users to search by label. 
3. Allowing users to search by keyword.
4. Allowing users to search by title. 
   
## Decision Outcome
We knew that we wanted a seach bar that can help easily filter through journals. We initially decided on options (1) and (2). On the developer end, searching by a specific date or searching by a specific label will be easier to implement since we will look for the particular date string and the label string. This will still allow the user to filter through their journals. If time allows, we can implement the search by keyword and search by title.
