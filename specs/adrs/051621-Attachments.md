# Journal Attachments (Images, Sound, etc.)
Date: [05-16-2021]

## Context and Problem Statement
Part of the appeal of a digital bullet journal is the ability to add alternative media to text to one's entries. User may want to add images, sound, video, and more as attachments to their journal entries.

## Considered Options
1. We may allow for one image/video/sound attachment per journal entry.
2. We may allow for multiple attachments per journal entry.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: (1), because we have a limited amount of time to work on the project. We also will not provide functionality for the user to edit the image/video/sound they attach to an entry as this isn't considered essential; the main purpose of a bullet journal is to help the user organize their schedule and stay on top of deadlines. This is a lower priority item, and will be completed only if all other core features are completed and tested.
