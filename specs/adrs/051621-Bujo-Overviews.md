# Bullet Journal Section/Overviews
Date: [05-16-2021]

## Context and Problem Statement
Bullet journals are often organized by date so that an author/user can easily find what assignment or task needs to be completed by a certain time. While daily/weekly/monthly/yearly overviews are common, it's possible for a bullet journal to be organized by different criteria. 

## Considered Options
We could choose to implement:
1. Daily/Weekly/Monthly/Yearly Views
2. Monthly/Past/Future/Custom Views
3. High Priority/Low Priority/Completed columns

## Decision Outcome

We have overhauled our BuJo design after getting feedback from the professor, and so we've decided to go with option (3) now. Our new BuJo design forgoes sectioning off bullets to specific days/weeks. Instead of having entries that are structured according to some sort of chronological ordering like days or weeks, we instead just have individiually dated bullets that will belong to one of three columns: High Priority, Low Priority, and Completed. The idea behind this design is to make the bullets themselves as first-class citizens, and focus less on days/weeks themselves. The completed column will keep completed bullets for a week, and then after a week it will store bullets into an archive of past bullets. We also may later on split the archive into two sections: a past archive and future archive for bullets that are in the very far-off future. The future archive idea though is something that we might only do if we have time later.
