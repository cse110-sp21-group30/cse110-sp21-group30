# Labels
Date: [05-16-2021]

## Context and Problem Statement
Individuals may have lots of tasks to fulfil, and the BuJo might get cluttered with all this information. We want to allow users to add certain attributes to their journal entries to further help with organization. 

## Considered Options
1. Custom tags that users can create and attach as labels to their journal
2. Predetermined tags that users can use as attributes.

## Decision Outcome
We decided to implement option (2) initially because while giving the user less control, it is easier for us as developers to know what labels are being used.  Examples of these predetermined labels include Deadline, Event, School, Fitness, etc. Each label will be assigned a specific color so that the user can easily identify what label is attached to each bullet point. If a user decides to search by label, we will simply set the specific bullet points that don;t match the label as invisible, rather rather than removing the entire point. This will be easy to manage on our end, and easy for the user to take advantage of.
