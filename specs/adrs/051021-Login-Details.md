# User Login Details
Date: [05-10-2021]

## Context and Problem Statement
We want to allow users to access their personal Bullet Journal's in a hassle-free way. How we handle login-details will affect 
ease of use and security. 

## Considered Options
1. We could allow users to only login with their username (no password), similar to how When2Meet handles logins. 
2. Ask users to create a password as well as a username in order to login to their BuJo. 

## Decision Outcome
We initially decided on option (1) because we only have a limited amount of time to finish the project and creating a secure, multi-layered pasword handling system would take too much time. However, after discussing with TA Deepak, we may need to pivot to option (2) because it can be considered too insecure. Our original intent was for the BuJo to be only a private application to be shared with friends but this may not be acceptable enough reasoning for lack of a password. We will have a meeting with the professor to decide if we should pivot to option (2). If we are allowed to implement password handling in a way that does not need to be intensively secure, then the time it takes to implement will not be too difficult to manage.
