# Search
Date: [05-16-2021]

## Context and Problem Statement
As users add more entries into the BuJo, it gets harder to manage all the entries and look for a particular one. We would like users to be able to search through their extensive list of journals in a simple manner.

## Considered Options
1. Allowing users to search by date.
2. Allowing users to search by label. 
3. Allowing users to search by keyword.
4. Allowing users to search by title. 
   
## Decision Outcome
We knew that we wanted a seach bar that can help easily filter through journals. We initially decided on options (1) and (2). On the developer end, searching by a specific date or searching by a specific label will be easier to implement since we will look for the particular date string and the label string. This will still allow the user to filter through their journals. In order to search by date or label, we will simply set all the bullet points that do not match the given criteria to invisible, and display only the ones that match the criteria. Our current implementation will not be removing bullet points that don't match the criteria because we believe it will be harder to store them in local storage and bring them back when needed on the developer end. If time allows, we can implement the search by keyword and search by title, but this is a lower priority at the moment since we want to get a more basic version of the feature working.
