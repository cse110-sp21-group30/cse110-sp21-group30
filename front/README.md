    * Create button should pop up an Editior pop-up

3. This month Tab

## Next Meeting: 

### Try to understand more in depth of the lab 6. We want to be using DOM, web compoents and iterate through JSON objects and display to the users. Also take a look at nagigating tabs as well as making modal. Please take a look at the main.html and main.css and try implementing things around before our next meeting. During next meeting, we will try to implement things listed above.
