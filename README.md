# Requirements
- A stable internet connection.
- The bullet journal performs best when accessed using a desktop computer and Google Chrome browser.
# Functionalities
Users can click on the cool beans logo in the top left of the header to pick their favorite color theme. This theme will stick even if the user refreshes the page!

The default view in our Bullet Journal is a 3-column display with sections for tasks that are In Progress, tasks that you haven't started yet (Backlog), and tasks that are Complete. Hovering the cursor over each bullet point will reveal 'left' and 'right' buttons that allow the user to move bullets between sections.

Users may manually archive 'Complete' tasks using the 'Archive' button, however, completed tasks will automatically be archived after a period of time. Archived bullets can be viewed by clicking the Archive toggle in the header.

Users may also completely delete, *not archive*, bullets by hovering over them, clicking the edit button, and selecting "Delete Bullet". Archived bullets can be deleted en masse through the delete button by the Archive section's header. Similarly, active bullet points can be mass deleted by clicking the clear-all button. This will also reset the color theme to the default!

The editor becomes visible upon clicking the editor button in the bottom right of the page, wherein the user can create new bullet points. The user can also edit existing bullet points by hovering over them, clicking the edit button, making the necessary changes, and clicking the button that reads "Save Changes".

The Cool Bean bullet journal supports search capabilities via specified date or label by clicking the search button located at the top-right of the screen.
